# Express MVC Boilerplate
This boilerplate uses the following tools :
* Express
* Pug
* Mongoose

The use of MongoDB is not obligatory; yet everything is set up for you to use it.
This boilerplate is made for my own uses but anyone can use it.


Also, comments are done respecting the JSDoc standard, and VIm foldings to keep everything organized. Thus, it's a boilerplate made for VIm users.
